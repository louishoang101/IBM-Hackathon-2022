In an ideal world, brick-and-mortar stores can run without worrying too much about security due to systems and setups put in place by the government of their respective localities.Things are quite different with e-commerce businesses, however; the onus to protect yourself is on you, and having a clear understanding of the various security threats and ways to protect yourself is important.Retail e-commerce sales is projected to hit $4.13 trillion this year.In terms of actual percentage of retail sales, this means e-commerce will account for 15.5 percent of total global ecommerce sales in 2020.While the actual e-commerce figure and percentage of retail sales e-commerce is responsible for continues to rise, so do the threats and challenges associated with e-commerce.This study makes it clear that while e-commerce is very promising, the threats are very real and should be taken seriously.It is also important to realize that simply relying on the built-in security features of your online store builder or CMS of choice won’t cut it.
Just last year, a report found that the number of Magento 2 stores compromised by malware doubled monthly for three consecutive months.So effective e-commerce security goes beyond simply relying on your e-commerce CMS; it is essential to have an understanding of the different security threats and to take adequate measures to protect yourself.This article details the six most dangerous e-commerce security threats you should watch out for and the steps you can take to protect yourself.Contrary to what many expect, most e-commerce security threats do not require use of groundbreaking technology on the part of the hacker.
Most security threats only require a bit of social engineering and deception toward key people at the target organization.The eBay database hack – in which personal details belonging to 145 million users were stolen – wasn’t due to hackers being able to break into eBay’s computers.
It was due to hackers compromising the login details of three key eBay employees, and then using this detail to gain access to the eBay network.A lot of e-commerce security threats operate in a similar way.
Let’s explore ways you can protect yourself from these e-commerce security threats.Many e-commerce business owners aren’t aware of how much of a threat phishing poses to their business, yet it is consistently one of the main ways hackers take over e-commerce sites.Phishing is a method in which a hacker sends deceptive emails disguised as an email from someone or an organization that you know in an attempt to get you to reveal your login details.
Wrongly assuming the email to be legitimate, you give them your details which they take note of and use it to log in to the actual site and perpetrate their crime.Phishing is so common that a whopping 76 percent of businesses have reported being a victim of a phishing attack in the past year.
In fact, 37.9 percent of untrained users fail phishing tests, so it might be a good idea to learn how to identify phishing attacks and train your employees also to prevent your e-commerce business from being compromised.Spam emails are also one of the major threats to e-commerce stores, and it is one of the major ways through which some of the attacks on this list are carried out.In a lot of cases, phishing attacks and malware attacks are carried out through spam emails.
Spammers also occasionally hack the email accounts of individuals or organizations you know and then use these emails to send spam emails aimed at compromising your ecommerce store hoping that you will believe them to be legitimate.These emails can sometimes link to phishing sites or link to infected sites that can compromise your computer security.A distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack, is an attack in which an attacker uses multiple computers to hit your server with fake traffic in order to make your website inaccessible, or unable to function properly, for legitimate users.While many are used to hearing about sites “hacked” or compromised in a way that leads to data being exposed, very few are familiar with DDoS attacks and how damaging they can be; even the biggest e-commerce brands have fallen victim to these attacks.There have been reports of major e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, Shopify and PayPal suffering significant downtimes due to these attacks.
Once successful, this changes how your site reads key data and allows the hacker to execute certain commands on your site or shut it down at will.Pretty much any e-commerce site that uses an SQL database is vulnerable to an SQL attack.
As such, the first thing you should do is to make sure that data gotten from you is pretty useless should you get hacked.While you continue to take measures to ensure you don’t suffer from a data breach, you should also make sure you properly encrypt all of your data so that the impact of a data breach on you and your users will be little or none even if there is a data breach.When encryption is enabled on your e-commerce server, user data is converted from normal text into “cipher text” that can only be read once decrypted; depending on the level of encryption used, very few people are able to decrypt properly encrypted data.Since payment is a core component of your e-commerce business, it is very important to take careful measures to ensure that your payment gateway is secure.Many e-commerce businesses become a victim of credit card and debit card fraud due to using unreliable payment gateways; most online store builders will allow you to integrate with dozens of popular payment gateways including PayPal, Stripe, and other enterprise payment gateways, so there is no excuse for not using a reliable one.Using an SSL certificate is one of the best ways to protect yourself as an e-commerce business.
When properly installed, an SSL certificate will encrypt all of the information users send on your e-commerce website and make it difficult for hackers to eavesdrop on this data or make any meaning of it should they eavesdrop on it.Google generally ranks sites that use SSL better, and users also tend to trust e-commerce stores that use a wildcard SSL certificate.
In a lot of cases, a properly configured firewall will protect your e-commerce site from most DDoS attacks.Your e-commerce business is only as robust as the security systems you put in place to protect it from being hijacked by malicious hackers.
